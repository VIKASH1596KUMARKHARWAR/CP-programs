 3.COPY ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR(=)


    DESTRUCTOR:Jo hamare obj ki allocated memory h use deallocate krwana
         --same name as our class
         --no return type,no input argument
         --Defult contructor k aage ~(telda operator)
         --like constructr...it also called at once in  lifetime of an obj
         --called automatically for the statically define objects but for the dyaminc one need to do explicitely
                    `use   delete object_name` yeh pointer jb  khud free hoga tb toh destructor ko call kr lega
