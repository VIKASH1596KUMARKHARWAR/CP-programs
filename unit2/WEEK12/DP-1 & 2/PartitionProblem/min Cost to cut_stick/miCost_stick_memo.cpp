/*Time Complexity Analysis
Number of Subproblems:

The memoization table memo[i][j] stores results for all possible subproblems defined by pairs (i, j). Since i and j can range from 0 to m - 1 (where m is the number of cuts plus two endpoints), the total number of subproblems is approximately ùëÇ(ùëö2)

Cost of Each Subproblem :

    For each subproblem defined
    by(i, j),
    the function considers every possible cut idx between i and j.The number of possible cuts between i and j is approximately O(m),
    as idx can range from i + 1 to j - 1. Total Time Complexity :

    Each subproblem is solved in O(m) time(due to iterating over possible cuts idx)
        .There are ùëÇ(ùëö2) subproblems.Thus,

   `````````````````````` the overall time complexity is O(m 3),

    where m is the number of elements in the cuts array plus the two endpoints.Space Complexity
    Memoization Table :

    The memo table has a size of m√óm,
    where m is the number of elements in cuts plus the two endpoints.Thus,
    the space complexity due to memoization is
    O(m 2)
        .Recursive Call Stack :

    The maximum depth of the recursion stack is O(m)
in the worst case, where each level represents a segment between two cuts.Total Space Complexity:

The total space complexity is

    O(m 2) due to the memoization table and O(m) due to the recursion stack,
    so the overall space complexity is dominated by
    O(m 2).
