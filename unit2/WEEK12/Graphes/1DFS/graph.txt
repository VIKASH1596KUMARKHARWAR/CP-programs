total degree of  a undirected graph is 2 * e
cyclic/acyclic/undirected/directed


for directed graphs,degree of a vertex = incomming edges
for undirected, degree of a vertex is total edges passes to that vetex


-- adjacency matrix
for 1-based indexing of adjacency matrix --> define it by n+1 vertex 
corresponding to that put 1  and for other put 0

--adjacency list
 

adjacency list -- in cpp its just vector
 0(2e)-->to store the graph
